# To-do
A simple todo list app built in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

- HTML: Provides the structure of the app, including input fields where users can enter new tasks, buttons to add tasks, and a list where tasks are displayed. Each task may have options to mark it as complete or delete it.

- CSS: Styles the app to make it visually appealing. It controls the layout, fonts, colors, and overall appearance, ensuring the interface is clean and user-friendly.

- JavaScript: Powers the app's functionality. It handles adding tasks to the list when the user submits a new task, marking tasks as completed when clicked, and removing tasks from the list when deleted. JavaScript also dynamically updates the task list, allowing users to interact with the app in real-time.

Overall, the app enables users to organize their tasks easily and keep track of what needs to be done.
